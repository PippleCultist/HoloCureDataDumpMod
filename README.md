# Holocure Data Dump Mod
A Holocure mod that lets you dump various data to a log.
## Installation Steps
- Download `HoloCureDataDumpMod.dll` and `CallbackManagerMod.dll` from the latest version of the mod https://github.com/PippleCultist/HoloCureDataDumpMod/releases
- Download `AurieManager.exe` from the latest version of Aurie https://github.com/AurieFramework/Aurie/releases
    - Note: This launcher may be marked as a Trojan by your antivirus. Aurie is opensource and has been used in several modding communities without issues.
- Launch `AurieManager.exe`, click `Add Game`, and select `HoloCure.exe`
    - You can find `HoloCure.exe` through Steam by clicking `Browse local files`
- Click `Install Aurie`
- Click `Add Mods` and add `HoloCureDataDumpMod.dll` and `CallbackManagerMod.dll`
- Running the game either using the executable or through Steam should now launch the mods as well
## Common Issues
If you get issues saying `Missing game executable` when trying to run the game, it's likely that Windows Defender or your antivirus is blocking `AurieLoader.exe` from installing. Try putting it in the whitelist or manually downloading it from `https://github.com/AurieFramework/Aurie/releases` and putting it in the mods folder.
## Usage
Some information can only be dumped when you enter a stage or holo house. Some data will be very large, so make sure to remove/disable the mod whenever you don't need to use it to avoid unnecessary logs.
